\title{Deflate Costs for Health Economic Models}
\usage{
deflate_costs(costs, from_year, to_year, deflator_version = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{costs}{Numeric vector of cost values to deflate}

\item{from_year}{Integer. The year the costs are currently in}

\item{to_year}{Integer. The year to deflate costs to}

\item{deflator_version}{Data frame with columns 'year', 'pce_health', and 'phce'.
If NULL (default), uses the built-in deflator_series data (most recent version).
To use a specific version, load it with \code{data(deflators_MM_YYYY)} and pass it here.}
}
\value{
Numeric vector of deflated costs
}
\description{
Converts costs from one year to another using inflation rates from a deflator series.
By default, uses the built-in deflator_series dataset, but custom deflator series
can be provided.
}
\examples{
# Deflate a single cost from 2020 to 2023
deflate_costs(10000, from_year = 2020, to_year = 2023)

# Deflate multiple costs
costs <- c(10000, 15000, 20000)
deflate_costs(costs, from_year = 2021, to_year = 2024)

# Use a specific version for reproducibility
data(deflators_01_2026)
deflate_costs(10000, 2020, 2022, deflators_01_2026)
